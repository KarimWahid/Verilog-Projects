# Verilog-Projects
### Sample Projects for the purpose of self-study and practice, including:
1- **N-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with the following operations according to a 4-bit selection vector 'SEL':** (All logical operations are performed on A)
'0000' Addition                 '0001' Subtraction                  '0010' Multiplication                    '0011' Division
'0100' Logical shift left       '0101' Logical shift right          '0110' Rotate left                       '0111' Rotate right
'1000' Logical AND              '1001'Logical OR                    '1010' Logical XOR                       '1010' Logical NOR 
'1011' Logical NAND             '1101'Logical XNOR                  '1110' Greater comparison                '1111' Equal comparison
